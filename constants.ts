For now, the product remains free with Stripe donation options, but a paid version may come down the pipeline if it becomes too expensive to manage. I referenced several previous projects to make sure I was on the right track throughout development, as well as relevant documentation.",

      "A free schedule generator app for people who work rotating shifts based on a 24-hour basis instead of a Monday-Friday schedule. The app accepts input and returns a schedule based on the type of rotation the user needs to build around, with output displayed in the form of a simple, asthetic calendar. This project allows for either Google login, GitHub, or magic link login with an email address. The app has a built in light/dark/system toggle and intuitive navogation layout. There are plans to shift the user specific navigation into a sidebar, and to allow for more intricate schedule building and to update each individual day with adjustments such as vacation, appointments etc.",

    challenge:
      "This project was at the time the largest react application I'd built, and with that came some challenges: for one, I struggled a bit with sharing state between components and pages. I failed to realize that the concept I was inventing in my head and almost in my code already existed in the form of useContext. Once that was out of the way, I found some difficulty in positioning certain elements exactly where I wanted them so they looked presentable both on desktop and mobile, but a few Tailwind size adjustments sorted that out.",
    about:
      "Engaging in this project introduced me to many new concepts within React. I dove headfirst into the useContext hook and scoured the React documentation to gain what I believe is a working grasp of its uses. In the end, I am happy with the outcome. The goal was to create something purposely generic and minimal, and I believe thatâ€™s what I have achieved.

In order to get the layout I needed for desktop, I had to rebuild using Grid instead. No huge issues with the transition, but it did set me back a bit. The purpose of this project for me was to test how quickly and how closely I could take a design file and produce a finished project.",
    about:
      "This project was taken from Frontendmentor.io, supplying the design and expected outcome. I used Tailwind and a few React components to bring the design file to life, in a form as close to pixel-perfect as I could get without excruciating adjustments. The project took approximately 3 hours of work from download to finished project. The time was mostly due to the experience I have with the tools I used.",
