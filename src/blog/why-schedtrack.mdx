{/*I am the sole developer of the web application Schedtrack. In its current state,
it is essentially a complete project unless there's a need for a bug fix. Which is kind of bittersweet.
Schedtrack started almost 2 years ago, when I began to take web development seriously,
and it was born out of personal necessity. 
<br />
I was working at the time as a 911 Dispatcher, so when
someone called needing the police or an ambulance or fire department I was answering the phones
and sending them. This being a 24/7 operation, and to keep things fair for the team of dipsatchers,
our schedules were based on a 6 day week. So I would work 4 consecutive days and then have 2 days off meaning
my schedule changed every week. Only slightly though, every week my work days shifted backwards one day.
So if I worked Monday to Thursday one week, the next i would work sunday to wednesday. This kind of thing
is easy to map out short term, but to plan anything even a few months ahead would become complicated and often
times I would make plans outside of work wihtout much thought and if I needed to take time off for a doctor's
appointment down the road I would. But thats no way to live! I had been fooling around with python scripts at
the time and did a bit of research into web decelopment and realized I could probably put something together
to organize my schedule. 
<br />
I set to learning HTML and CSS with the help of some popular youtubers and other free
online resources. Then it ws on to Javascript, which is always a bit intimidating to new developers, that first
language always is. I put all my spare time and all my effort into learning the language and trying to figure out how I could use it to make my life easier.
Schedtrack started out as not much more than a simple for loop that would print out my schedule for the next few months.
I would set a start date, gave the days of the week a value from 0 to 6 and mapped over the dates where based on what the
 start date was, I would count 4 days of work then 2 days would follow assigned as days off. */}
 Coming soon!
